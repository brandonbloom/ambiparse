TODO
  - improved error reporting and recovery
    - form to filter internal ambiguity
  - more disambiguation filters:
    - preceeds/follows restruction
  - Consider cut operator. See:
    Packrat Parsers Can Handle Practical Grammars in Mostly Constant Space
    "Tell" version of errors - can "commit" or "abort" current node.

Known Issues
  - epsilon infinite loops
  - eof infinite loops
  - bad error messages from nested alts or multiple-rightmost partial parses
  - * and + do not set ::a/structure
  - caught exceptions are frequently swallowed by unprincipaled recovery

Perf Ideas
  - avoid nodes for constant terminals
  - records/protocols for pattern objects
  - record for concrete syntax trees
  - can sub graphs be garbage collected after buffered nodes are flushed?
  - use pre-allocated exception for fail!
  - dispatch node
    - based on what's parsed, gen rule.
    - like alt with the opposite of a head-fail


Concern: Dispatch dynamically creates patterns.
  What if a pattern created has a closure?
