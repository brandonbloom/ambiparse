TODO
  - improved error reporting and recovery
    - form to filter internal ambiguity
  - more disambiguation filters:
    - preceeds/follows restruction
  - Consider cut operator. See:
    Packrat Parsers Can Handle Practical Grammars in Mostly Constant Space
    "Tell" version of errors - can "commit" or "abort" current node.
  - does tail? still even make sense?

Known Issues
  - epsilon infinite loops
  - eof infinite loops
  - bad error messages from nested alts or multiple-rightmost partial parses
  - * and + do not set ::a/structure

Perf Ideas
  - avoid nodes for constant terminals
  - records/protocols for pattern objects
  - record for concrete syntax trees
  - can tail contexts be generalized to tail-fail?
  - can sub graphs be garbage collected after buffered nodes are flushed?
