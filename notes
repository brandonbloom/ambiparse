TODO
  - error recovery
  - more disambiguation filters:
    - preceeds/follows restruction
  - Consider cut operator. See:
    Packrat Parsers Can Handle Practical Grammars in Mostly Constant Space
    "Tell" version of errors - can "commit" or "abort" current node.
  - Is tail? as part of the node id correct? necessary?

Known issues:
  - epsilon infinite loops
  - bad error messages from nested alts or multiple-rightmost partial parses

Perf Idea:
  - on construction of a pattern, compute a "lead" predicate on the first char
  - test the lead-predicate on add-node / add-edge to prevent creation
