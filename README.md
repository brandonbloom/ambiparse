# Ambiparse

Yet another parsing library for Clojure.

## Usage

Don't.

## Motivation

[Instaparse][1] is an awesome library (that you can actually use!) based on
[GLL Combinators][2]. Since doing is learning, I wanted to give the [Parsing
With Derivatives][3] approach a try myself. Furthmore, I'd like to attempt
adapting [Disambiguation Filters][4] to work with derivatives.
